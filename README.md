# 340Project1

The goal of this project is to implement and evaluate the performance of several CPU scheduling algorithms by writing a 
program that will simulate their executions. There are several important data structures (e.g., PCB, ready queue, blocked 
queue, etc.) that you have to implement in order to carry out the simulation. The management (mainly the ordering of PCBs in 
the ready queue) of those data structures will depend on the particular scheduling algorithm that is being simulated. 
The following CPU scheduling algorithms will be evaluated: first come first serve, round robin and shortest job first
